#Parallel Streams
Idea is to utilize the multiple cores on our machine, to get the results faster
When we use parallel Streams, multiple threads are used to process our data in parallel.
Behind the scenes, it is actually the fork join framework(worker threads in common pool) in action which is abstracted away from us.
No. of threads in common pool is (no. of processors - 1).
parallel stream - splitting, processing and merging. (divide and conquer approach)

# Best tool to measure performance of parallel streams is JMH - Java Microbenchmark Harness
