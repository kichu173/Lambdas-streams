Introduction to Method Reference
• Short hand for Lambdas calling an existing method
(String s) -> s.toUpperCase() can be rewritten as String::toUpperCase
(sl, s2) -> s1.compareToIgnoreCase(s2) can be written as String::compareToIgnoreCase

• Compact, Better readability
(x, y) -> x + y / String::concat/Integer::sum/Double::sum

• Type checking process remains the same as Lambda expressions
• target reference :: method name
